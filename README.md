## Technical choices
####    NextJs
I decided to use Nextjs as a framework for React since it offers many features out of the box (lazy-loading, Built-in router..) but also the flexibility of using SSR or SSG.

#### Tailwind css
Fast and ease of use.

#### Architecture
On top of the architecture of NextJs, a folder ```components``` containing ```[componentName]``` folder and within it the ```[component].js``` and eventually ```[component].spec.js``` for unit test, keeping each 'Part' of the application bundled together
 
 ## Improvements
 - SSG most of the pages 
 - Reuse most redundant css
 - Typographie system
